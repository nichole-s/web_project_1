## Purpose

## Content

* BEM methodology

* Specific file structure

* HTML

* CSS

* Iframes

* Interactivity through animations and transformation

* Flex display

* Positioning

## Going Forward

I'm not 100% sure what is next with this, though I expect I will be adding on to this site throughout my time with Practicum at Yandex. There are a few links that currently go nowhere, and I'll bet that eventually I will write the code for the future destination. (At least I hope that is the plan!)
